/**
 * Inter Variable, SIL Open Font License 1.1 (see `app/licenses/Inter-OFL-1.1.txt`).
 *
 * Chosen over Roboto for three reasons that matter to this app specifically: it ships tabular
 * figures and a slashed zero (the UI is full of numeric readouts), its tall x-height and open
 * apertures read far better at TV viewing distance, and one variable file covers every weight.
 *
 * `minSdk` is 23 but variable-font axes need API 26. On 23–25 the file loads at its default
 * instance and Compose applies synthetic bolding — an acceptable degradation on a shrinking
 * slice of devices.

/**
 * Weight and tracking are baked into each style, so call sites stop appending
 * `fontWeight = FontWeight.ExtraBold` by hand — which is how the previous UI ended up with the
 * same visual role rendered at three different weights on three different screens.
 *
 * **Every `letterSpacing` here must be `sp`, and every style must set one explicitly.**
 * `TextUnit` arithmetic throws `IllegalArgumentException: Cannot perform operation for Sp and Em`
 * when the two operands use different units, and Material components lerp between typography
 * styles — `OutlinedTextField` animates its label between `bodyLarge` and `bodySmall`, for one.
 * An earlier revision expressed tracking in `em` but left `titleSmall` and `bodyLarge` on
 * Material's `sp` defaults, which crashed the Stream settings page the moment a text field with a
 * label was composed. Material also lerps against its own hardcoded `sp` styles, so `sp`
 * throughout is the only combination that cannot collide. `TypographyUnitsTest` enforces this.
