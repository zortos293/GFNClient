/// whose Windows build already reacts to a Windows digitizer — invariably because they also ship on
/// phones or tablets — and they switch to their own mobile UI the moment one appears. So this file
/// decides nothing about *how* touch works, only *where* it gets turned on.
///
/// The catalog carries the answer: a launch option's `supportedControls` includes `TOUCHSCREEN`,
/// the same capability signal the official client uses. Reading that signal replaces the
/// title-matched "fortnite" check the iOS build shipped with, which missed every other touch title
/// and broke for localized names.
