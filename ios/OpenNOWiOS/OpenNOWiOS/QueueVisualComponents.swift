/// restarted its own drift animation mid-flight. The second replaced that with a full-screen
/// `Canvas`, which fixed the invalidation but still re-rasterised four full-screen fills — two of
/// them radial gradients — on the main thread twenty times a second, while the same thread was
/// holding a WebRTC connection open. That was the remaining jank.

/// rasterised by Core Animation and an `.offset` is a layer transform, so drift costs a
/// recomposite rather than a redraw — the render server's job, not the main thread's. The phase

/// The indeterminate bar shown while waiting for a rig.
///
/// Three things had to be true before this stopped reading as stuck, and each was found the hard
/// way:
///
/// 1. **Position comes from the clock, not from `@State`.** The queue screen observes the whole
///    store, so it re-renders on every poll, every trend sample and every ad-state update, and each
///    of those re-evaluated an implicit `repeatForever` animation and restarted it mid-flight.
/// 2. **No ancestor may re-interpolate that position.** The screen animates the queue numeral with
///    a spring, and an implicit animation applies to the whole subtree — so every offset the
///    timeline produced was being spring-interpolated towards the next one, which is exactly the
///    lag a clock-driven animation is supposed to make impossible. `.transaction` clears it.
/// 3. **It travels one way, at a constant speed.** This used to ping-pong with a smoothstep ease,
///    which meant it spent most of each cycle decelerating into a turn or accelerating out of one
///    — near-stationary at both ends, twice every two seconds. Reported as "going back and forth
///    so slow". A sweep that runs off one end and re-enters the other never appears to stall,
///    which is why the system's own indeterminate bar works that way.
///
/// The traveller is a plain `Capsule` moved with `.offset`, so a tick is a layer transform on the
/// render server rather than a `Canvas` redraw on the main thread — which matters on the one screen
/// that is also holding a WebRTC connection open.
